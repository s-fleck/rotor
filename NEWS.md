# rotor 0.2.1 (2019-05-15)

* added examples to `rotate()` documentation
* `dry_run` status is now tracked internally instead of a potentially user 
  modifiable `option()` (it was never designed to be user modifiable anyways). 
* Track test coverage with covr
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
