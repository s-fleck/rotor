**rotor** provides a cross platform R reimagination of
[logrotate](https://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate) as a companion
package to <https://github.com/s-fleck/lgr>. In addition to rotating log
files, it can also be used as a (primitive) backup tool. For
conditionally creating and deleting backups, rotor relies solely on
information encoded in the filename suffix of the backups (i.e. the
timestamp or index). It therefore also works with backups created by
other tools, as long as the filename has a format that rotor can deal
with.

`rotate()`, `rotate_date()`, and `rotate_time()` move a file and insert
a suffix (either an integer or a timestamp) into the filename. In
addition, they create an empty file in place of the original one. This
is useful for log rotation. `backup()`, `backup_date()` and
`backup_time()` do the same but keep the original file.

See the [function
reference](https://s-fleck.github.io/rotor/reference/index.html) for

details

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of rotor from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- install.packages("rotor") -->

<!-- ``` -->

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("s-fleck/rotor")
```

## Example

Before we run the examples for rotor, we have to setup a temporary
directory and an example log file.

``` r
library(rotor)

# setup test file for examples
dr <- tempdir()
td <- file.path(dr, "rotor")
dir.create(td, recursive = TRUE)
tf <- file.path(td, "mylogfile.log")
writeLines("An important message", tf)
```

`backup()` makes a copy of a file and inserts an index between the
filename and the file extension. The file with the index `1` is always
the most recently made backup.

``` r
backup(tf)

# backup and rotate also support compression
backup(tf, compression = TRUE) 

# display backups of a file
list_backups(tf)  
#> [1] "/tmp/Rtmpe34fYM/rotor/mylogfile.1.log.zip"
#> [2] "/tmp/Rtmpe34fYM/rotor/mylogfile.2.log"
```

`rotate()` also makes a copy, but replaces the original file with an
empty one.

``` r
rotate(tf)
list_backups(tf)
#> [1] "/tmp/Rtmpe34fYM/rotor/mylogfile.1.log"    
#> [2] "/tmp/Rtmpe34fYM/rotor/mylogfile.2.log.zip"
#> [3] "/tmp/Rtmpe34fYM/rotor/mylogfile.3.log"

# the original file is now empty
readLines(tf)
#> character(0)

# its content was moved to the first backup
readLines(list_backups(tf)[[1]])
#> [1] "An important message"

writeLines("another important message", tf)
```

The `max_backups` parameter limits the maximum number of backups rotor
will keep of a file. Notice how the zipped backup we created above moves
to index 4 as we create two new backups.

``` r
backup(tf, max_backups = 4)
backup(tf, max_backups = 4)

list_backups(tf)
#> [1] "/tmp/Rtmpe34fYM/rotor/mylogfile.1.log"    
#> [2] "/tmp/Rtmpe34fYM/rotor/mylogfile.2.log"    
#> [3] "/tmp/Rtmpe34fYM/rotor/mylogfile.3.log"    
#> [4] "/tmp/Rtmpe34fYM/rotor/mylogfile.4.log.zip"
```

We can also use `prune_backups()` to delete old backups. Other than
ensuring that no new backups is created, it works equivalent to using
`backup()` with the `max_backups` parameter. By setting it to `0`, we
delete all backups.

``` r
prune_backups(tf, max_backups = 0)
```

Besides creating backup up with an index, **rotor** can also create
timestamped backups.

``` r
backup_date(tf)
rotate_time(tf)
list_backups(tf)
#> [1] "/tmp/Rtmpe34fYM/rotor/mylogfile.2019-05-15--08-33-07.log"
#> [2] "/tmp/Rtmpe34fYM/rotor/mylogfile.2019-05-15.log"
```

``` r
prune_backups(tf, max_backups = 0)  # cleanup
list_backups(tf)
#> character(0)
```

Besides passing a total number of backups to keep, `max_backups` can
also be a period or a date / datetime for timestamped backups.

``` r
# keep all backups younger than one year
prune_backups(tf, "1 year") 
  
# keep all backups after April 4th, 2018
prune_backups(tf, "2018-04-01")  
```

# Dependencies

**rotor**’s dependencies are intentionally kept slim. It only comes with
two non-base dependencies:

  - [R6](https://github.com/r-lib/R6): A light weight system for
    encapsulated object-oriented programming.
  - [dint](https://github.com/s-fleck/dint): A toolkit for working
    year-quarter and year-month dates that I am also the author of. It
    is used by `rotate_date()` and `rotate_time()` to deal with calendar
    periods.

Both packages have no transitive dependencies (i.e they do not depend on
anything outside of base R)
